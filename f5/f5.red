module f5;
% The F5 Algorithm for computing Groebner bases.
%
% The f5 module provides the implementation of the FaugÃ¨re's F5 algorithm
%     https://www-polsys.lip6.fr/~jcf/Papers/F02a.pdf
%
% The interface contains the operator `f5` with the following signature
%     `f5(polynomials: List, vars: List, order: Id)`
% Where
%   . `polynomials` is a list of expressions of Ideal generators;
%   . `vars` is a list of Reduce kernels with respect to which the basis is computed;
%     kernels not present in `vars` are treated as elements from the ground domain;
%   . `order` is a term order to compute the basis in,
%      possible options are `lex`, `revgradlex`;
%
% For example, one can use f5 in the following way:
%  > load_package f5;
%  > f5({x*y + 1, y*z + 1}, {x, y, z}, lex);

create!-package('(f5 f5core f5lp f5poly f5core f5primes f5mod), nil);

% f5modular - If f5 should use modular algorithms during computation.
%             Is set OFF by default, so all arithmetic operations
%             take place in the original coefficient domain.
switch f5modular;

% f5certify - If f5 should certify the correctness of result
%             during modular computation. Is set ON by default,
%             meaning that the output is guaranteed to be correct.
%             Otherwise, the algorithm is randomized and may
%             produce incorrect answer with a small probability
switch f5certify;
off1 'f5certify;

% f5fullreduce - If the resulting basis should be fully interreduced.
%                If this is ON, each generator in the output basis is
%                in the normal form with respect to other generators.
%                Otherwise, only head terms in the basis are reduced.
%                Is OFF by default.
switch f5fullreduce;

% f5integers - If to perform computations assuming ring arithmetic
%             for coefficients. If set ON, polynomials are not divided
%             by the leading coefficient during reductions.

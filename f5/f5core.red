%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% *** Notes on the implementation.
%
% In our implementation of the F5 algorithm all polynomials are wrapped
% in the LabeledPolynomial type (interface implemented in f5lp.red).
% LabeledPolynomial provides the `lp_eval` function to access the polynomial part itself.
% Further, we use the notions of "polynomial" and "labeled polynomial" interchangeably.
%
% Most of the functions below manipulate polynomials (represented as a LabeledPolynomial).
% Polynomials are stored in the `Basistracker` struct, which is usually passed
% as a function argument and has a name `r`. To get to these polynomials,
% integer indices are used. So, by saying "a polynomial at index k" we mean
% a polynomial stored in the Basistracker `r` at index k (our notation for this is `r_k`).
% To get the polynomial itself, `core_getPoly` is used.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% CriticalPair

% The struct implements the usual Critical Pair interface:
% the pair stores information about two polynomials to construct
% an S-polynomial from it later.
% Assuming there exist two polynomials `f1` and `f2` and their S-polynomial is
%   u*f1 - v*f2
% Then CriticalPair object is represented with a 6-item list
%   {'cp, tt, k, u, l, v}
% Where
%   tt is a Term for the lcm(leadTerm(f1), leadTerm(f2)),
%   k is an Integer for the index of `f1` in the current Basistracker (described below),
%   u is a Term for the multiplier of `f1`,
%   l is an Integer for the index of `f2` in the current Basistracker,
%   v is a Term for the multiplier of `f2`
%
% It is safe to assume that (k > l) or (k = l and u >= v).

asserted inline procedure core_CriticalPair(tt: Term, k: Integer, u: Term,
                                    l: Integer, v: Term): CriticalPair;

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% RewriteRule

% The struct implements Rewrite Rule interface to keep track of signatures
% that have already been produced during the f5 execution.
%
% A RewriteRule object is a list
%   {'rr, index, term}
% Here, index is an Integer, an index of polynomial from the Basistracker structure,
% and term is a Term, a multiplier of some signature.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Basistracker

% Implements the Basistracker struct. Basistracker instance is an object
% that stores all polynomials produced during f5 execution in a single vector.
% More precicely, a Basistracker instance is represented as
%   {'bt, polys, filled, capacity}
% Where
%   polys is a Vector of `Polynomial`s,
%   filled is an Integer equal to the number of elements added to `polys`,
%   capacity is an Integer equal to the length of `polys`
%
% In a single core_groebner1 call, a single Basistracker object is created.
% A LabeledPolynomial can be added to the current Basistracker with `core_addPoly`,
% and accessed with `core_getPoly`. To get the index of the last polynomial added
% use `core_getBasisIdx`.
%
% It safe to assume that polynomials added to the current Basistracker
% are normalized (either divided by the leading coeff if f5integers if OFF,
%                 or divided by the content if f5integers is ON).

% The most tricky part in F5 reduction, the top-reduction function.
% If the LabeledPolynomial being examined has polynomial part 0, then there
% is no data left in that particular Labeled polynomial - an
% empty ordered pair is returned.
%
% Otherwise top-reduction calls upon another sub-routine core_findReducer.
% Essentially, if core_findReducer returns 0, the current LabeledPolynomial
% is normalized and then it is added to the list `completed`
% defined within the core_reduction function.
%
% If a top-reduction is deemed possible, then there are two cases:
% either the reduction will increase the signature of the polynomial or it will not.
% In the latter case, the signature is preserved, the polynomial part
% is top-reduced and the LabeledPolynomial is added to the list `todo`
% in the core_reduction function.
% In the former case, however, the signature will change. This
% is marked by adding a new polynomial to r with appropriate
% signature which is equal to the signature of the top-reducer.
% A new rewrite rule is added and then
% both top-reduced and top-reducer polynomials and are added to the list `todo`
% in the core_reduction function. This is done because the
% top-reduced has a different signature than top-reducer and top-reducer might
% still be reducible by another LabeledPolynomial.
